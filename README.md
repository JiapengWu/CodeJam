Team name: CPPV

To access your schedule or your course sections, first open the "interface.py" file.
Information corresponding to students and courses are collected in data.py.
An Tkinter interface should popup with three options: "Student", "Teacher" and "Principal".
As a student you should be able to access your schedule using your ID.
As a teacher you can choose the subject you teach and view the students enrolled in your sections.
As the principal you can view the schedule of any student and all the course sections.

To do so, scroll down through the lists by clicking on "View Sections" or "View Schedules".

Note: If you open the interface and type in student's id, you need to close the tab and reaccess again.
